      <h2 id="hh2">Poverty: A General Overview</h2>
      <p>Every country has its dark and dirty secrets that they would rather never see the light of day, and the United States <br>
        is no exception. In 2019 and 2020, especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, San Francisco's tent cities saturated the <br>
        nightly news. Tents cities are not new to San Francisco, just like poverty is not new to the United States. <br>
        The Great Depression saw the U.S. with a historical unemployment rate estimated at more than 20%. With failing banks, <br>
        no jobs, and no security net to help those in need, millions of Americans fell into poverty (Great Depression History). <br>
        Because of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to stabilize the American economy and World War II, the Great Depression <br>
        came to an end. However, the poverty rate was estimated at 22.4% in 1959 (How Has Poverty Changed Over Time).</p>
        <p>In 1964, President Lydon B. Johnson declared a War on Poverty in his first State of the Union address. After <br>
        Michael Harrington’s 1962 book, The Other America, raised awareness of America’s poverty issue, President Johnson hoped to make <br>
        America a more fair and just country with a massive reform program known as the Great Society (Review Essay: 'the Other America' is <br>
        'Coming Apart', Lydon B. Johnson). In 1963, Mollie Orshansky, an employee at the Social Security Administration, published her first <br>
        version of poverty thresholds. President Johnson’s administration adopted Orshansky’s thresholds as a way to measure the War on Poverty <br>
        (From Hunter to Orshansky: An Overview of (Unofficial) Poverty Lines in the United States from 1904 to 1965). The poverty rate reached <br>
        an all-time low of 11% in 1973. It then fluctuated between 11% and a high of 15% for the next 37 years. The national poverty rate increased <br>
        for the fourth straight year in 2010, and 46.2 million people were living in poverty, the largest number in the 52 years since the first <br>
        published poverty report (How Has Poverty Changed Over Time and Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010). <br>
        The poverty rate reached a new all-time low of 10.5% in 2019. However, 2020 ushered in the Covid-19 pandemic, millions lost their jobs, <br>
        causing great concern among experts (Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2019).</p>
