        <p id="hp1">
          Every country has its dark and dirty secrets that they would rather
          never see the light of day, and the United States is no exception. In
          2019 and 2020, especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, San
          Francisco's tent cities saturated the nightly news. Tents cities are
          not new to San Francisco, just like poverty is not new to the United
          States. The Great Depression saw the U.S. with a historical
          unemployment rate estimated at more than 20%. With failing banks, no
          jobs, and no security net to help those in need, millions of Americans
          fell into poverty (Great Depression History). Because of President
          Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to stabilize the American economy and
          World War II, the Great Depression came to an end. However, the
          poverty rate was estimated at 22.4% in 1959 (How Has Poverty Changed
          Over Time). <br /><br />

          In 1964, President Lydon B. Johnson declared a War on Poverty in his
          first State of the Union address. After Michael Harrington’s 1962
          book, The Other America, raised awareness of America’s poverty issue,
          President Johnson hoped to make America a more fair and just country
          with a massive reform program known as the Great Society (Review
          Essay: 'the Other America' is 'Coming Apart', Lydon B. Johnson). In
          1963, Mollie Orshansky, an employee at the Social Security
          Administration, published her first version of poverty thresholds.
          President Johnson’s administration adopted Orshansky’s thresholds as a
          way to measure the War on Poverty (From Hunter to Orshansky: An
          Overview of (Unofficial) Poverty Lines in the United States from 1904
          to 1965). The poverty rate reached an all-time low of 11% in 1973. It
          then fluctuated between 11% and a high of 15% for the next 37 years.
          The national poverty rate increased for the fourth straight year in
          2010, and 46.2 million people were living in poverty, the largest
          number in the 52 years since the first published poverty report (How
          Has Poverty Changed Over Time and Income, Poverty, and Health
          Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010). The poverty rate
          reached a new all-time low of 10.5% in 2019. However, 2020 ushered in
          the Covid-19 pandemic, millions lost their jobs, causing great concern
          among experts (Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the
          United States: 2019).

        <h2 id="t2">Poverty Facts</h2>
        <div id="hl1">
          <ul>
            <li>
              The United States has one of the highest rates of child poverty
              among high-income countries.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2019, nearly 35 million people lived below the poverty line in
              the United States. Of those, 10 million were children.
            </li>
            <li>
              The poverty threshold guidelines first developed in 1963 are the
              same guidelines used today. They are adjusted for inflation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poverty does not discriminate. All races and ethnic groups are
              affected. By race, the highest child poverty rates are found among
              Native Americans.
            </li>
            <li>
              Children who grow up in poverty face a lifetime of challenges.
