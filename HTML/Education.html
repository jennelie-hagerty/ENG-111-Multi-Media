        Education is a way to achieve a better life. However, children who live
        in poverty do not receive the same educational experiences or have
        access to the same educational advantages as their non-poor peers.
        Schools located in poor neighborhoods do not have the funds to provide
        quality materials and educators for their students. These factors lead
        to the children receiving a less than adequate education, usually ending
        with the majority of them never completing high school. This is the
        first link in the cycle of poverty. Because of their lack of education,
        they cannot compete in the job market, causing them to settle for
        low-paying work or not able to secure a job. Such factors lead them to a
        life of crime and incarceration, leaving their families (if they have
        one) to fend for themselves (HuffPost).

        Research shows income is greatly influenced by the level of education
        achieved. As indicated by the table above, a household where the
        education level of the head of the house was less than 9th grade earned
        around $20,805, households with a high school graduate head of house
        earned $40,456, households with a bachelorâ€™s degree earned $77,605, and
        households headed by a person with a professional degree earned $100,000
        or more (U.S. Census Bureau). Research also shows that those with higher
        levels of education have less of a probability of going to prison.
