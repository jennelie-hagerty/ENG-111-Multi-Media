        <p id="pp1">
          Life for children living in poverty is devasting. Impoverished
          children lack food which leads to malnutrition, poor development, and
          poor health. Their unpredictable circumstances often lead to them
          developing mental health issues. The low-income communities they live
          in lack the funds to provide an education equal to their non-poor
          peers. These children are also more likely to become entangled in the
          child welfare and criminal justice systems. Factors such as these
          often lead to these children growing up to continue a seemingly
          unending cycle of hopelessness. Few children living in poverty ever
          grow up to break this vicious cycle (The Basic Facts About Children in
          Poverty). <br /><br />
          Just like child poverty is disproportionately high compared to the
          total population. Certain groups of children have a higher rate of
          poverty than others. Native American children have the highest poverty
          rates, followed by Black and Hispanic children. White and Asian child
          poverty rates are lower and about the same for both groups (How Has
          Poverty Changed Over Time and The Population of Poverty USA). Family
          structures are also associated with different poverty rates. Children
          from single-parent households are more likely to be poor. Children
          living in particular geographic locations, such as the Southern U.S.
          and U.S. territories, are more likely to grow up living in poverty
          (U.S. Census Bureau).
