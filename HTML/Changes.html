        <b>Changes</b> <br />
        <i>Tupac ft. Talent </i><br />
        Come on, come on<br />
        I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself<br />
        Is life worth living, should I blast myself?<br />
        I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm blac<br />k My stomach
        hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch <br /><br />
        Cops give a damn about a negro<br />
        Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero<br />
        Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares<br />
        One less hungry mouth on the welfare
        <br /><br />
        First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers<br />
        Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other<br />
        It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said<br />
        Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead<br />
        <br /><br />
        I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere<br />
        Unless we share with each other<br />
        We gotta start makin' changes<br />
        Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
        <br /><br />
        And that's how it's supposed to be<br />
        How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?<br />
        I'd love to go back to when we played as kids<br />
        But things changed, and that's the way it is<br />
        <br /><br />
        Come on, come on<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Ooh, yeah<br />
        Come on, come on<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Aww, yeah
        <br /><br />
        I see no changes, all I see is racist faces<br />
        Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races<br />
        We under, I wonder what it takes to make this<br />
        One better place, let's erase the wasted<br />
        <br /><br />
        Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right<br />
        'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight<br />
        And only time we chill is when we kill each other
        <br /><br />
        It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other<br />
        And although it seems heaven sent<br />
        We ain't ready, to see a black President<br />
        It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact<br />
        The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
        <br /><br />
        But some things will never change<br />
        Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game<br />
        Now tell me, what's a mother to do?<br />
        Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
        <br /><br />
        You gotta operate the easy way<br />
        (I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way<br />
        Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)<br />
        Well, hey, well, that's the way it is
        <br /><br />
        Come on, come on<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Aww, yeah<br />
        Come on, come on<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Aww, yeah
        <br /><br />
        We gotta make a change<br />
        It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes<br />
        Let's change the way we eat<br />
        Let's change the way we live<br />
        And let's change the way we treat each other<br />
        You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do<br />
        What we gotta do, to survive
        <br /><br />
        And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?<br />
        There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East<br />
        Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs<br />
        So the police can bother me
        <br /><br />
        And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do<br />
        But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you<br />
        Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up<br />
        Crack you up and pimps smack you up
        <br /><br />
        You gotta learn to hold ya own<br />
        They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone<br />
        But tell the cops, they can't touch this<br />
        I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this<br />
        <br /><br />
        That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?<br />
        But mama didn't raise no fool<br />
        And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped<br />
        And I never get to lay back<br />
        'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs<br />
        Some buck that I roughed up way back<br />
        Comin' back after all these years<br />
        Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
        <br /><br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is (Way it is)<br />
        Aww, yeah<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Things will never be the same<br />
        That's just the way it is<br />
        Aww, yeah<br />
        Some things will never change<br />
